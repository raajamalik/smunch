## To use or not to use Microservice, Microfrontend?

Whether to use microservices or not depends on several factors such as the complexity of the system, scalability, fault tolerance, etc. If you think that the system is complex enough and may require scaling different parts independently, or if there is a clear separation of concerns, then using microservices could be a good idea.

In your case, based on the user stories you shared, it seems that the system is not very complex, and there is no clear separation of concerns that would require a microservice architecture. Therefore, a monolithic architecture could be sufficient.

However, if you still want to use a microservice architecture, you could use NestJS to create different microservices for each entity, such as a user microservice, a restaurant microservice, a product microservice, a review microservice, and an order microservice. You can use different databases for each microservice and have them communicate with each other through a message broker like RabbitMQ or Kafka.

Another approach could be to create microservices based on the user stories. For example, you could have a microservice for listing restaurants and their products, another microservice for adding reviews, and another microservice for listing user's past orders. This approach would require careful consideration of the data flows and communication between microservices.


Using microservices for the backend doesn't necessarily mean that you need to use microfrontends for the frontend. The decision to use microfrontends depends on several factors, such as the size and complexity of the frontend application, the need for independent deployment and scalability of frontend components, and the team structure.

If your frontend application is relatively small and can be managed by a single team, a monolithic frontend architecture may be sufficient. However, if your frontend application is large and complex, and requires independent deployment and scalability of frontend components, then using microfrontends may be a good idea.

In general, the decision to use microservices and microfrontends should be based on careful consideration of the specific needs of your application and your team's capabilities.
